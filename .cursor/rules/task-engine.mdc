# Task Engine Framework

> [!AGENT_REQUEST]
> This rule defines the design and implementation principles for the Ryvr Task Engine. Use this rule when developing task-related functionality to ensure proper implementation of the task lifecycle, processing flow, and extension points.

## Core Concepts

### Task
A Task represents a discrete unit of work that needs to be performed, such as:
- Keyword research
- Content generation
- SEO auditing
- Ad copy creation
- Backlink analysis

### Task Definition
Each Task should be defined with:
- Unique identifier
- Human-readable name
- Description
- Required inputs
- Expected outputs
- Permissions required
- Credit cost
- Estimated completion time

### Task Status Flow
Tasks follow a specific lifecycle:
1. `DRAFT` - Task created but not submitted
2. `PENDING` - Task submitted and awaiting processing
3. `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` - Task requires manual approval to proceed
4. `PROCESSING` - Task is actively being processed
5. `COMPLETED` - Task finished successfully
6. `FAILED` - Task encountered an error
7. `CANCELED` - Task was canceled by user

## Implementation Guidelines

### Task Registration
- Each task type must register itself with the task registry
- Task definitions should be stored in the database for flexibility
- Allow for versioning of task definitions

### Task Scheduler
- Implement a priority-based task queue
- Support for scheduled/recurring tasks
- Handle task dependencies (tasks that must complete before others)
- Implement rate limiting per user/account
- Support distribution across multiple servers (future)

### Task Processor
- Process tasks asynchronously using background processing
- Implement timeout handling for long-running tasks
- Create checkpoint system for resumable tasks
- Record detailed logs of task execution
- Handle graceful failure and recovery

### Task Templates
- Allow saving task configurations as templates
- Support for organizational default templates
- Enable sharing templates between users
- Implement template versioning
- Support for template categories

## Extension Points
- Task definition hooks
- Pre-processing filters
- Post-processing actions
- Status transition events
- Results formatting
- Error handling callbacks
